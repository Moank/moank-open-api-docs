  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    The Moank Partner API can be used by Moank's partners in order to provide financial products to their end customers within their own application/website.

    # Test objects

    Test objects can be used in the staging environment in order to test specific flow. If one of the applicant of the application has its `socialSecurityNumber` equal to one of the test object, the `applicationStatus` returned by Moank for the create application endpoint will always be the same one as described in the following table:

    Social Security Number|Application Status|Comment
    ----------------------|------------------|-------
    199001010009 |`granted` `pending`|Will return `pending` if the application requires bank details and none were provided at this stage. The test event `grant-test-loan` can then be used to update the application to `granted`
    199001011114 |`pending`|-
    199001019992 |`denied`|-

    # Test events

    Test events can be used in the staging environment in order to trigger background process that will update the application status. Test events are not available in the production environment and should only be used for testing. The test events are described in the following table and they can be used in the [Send Application Endpoint](#tag/Application-endpoints/paths/~1application~1{applicationId}~1event/post):

    Test event |Description
    -----------|-----------
    `grant-test-loan`|Triggers a manual review on the application. The application status will be updated to `granted`.
    `sign-test-loan`|Triggers a signature of the loan agreement. The application status will be updated to `signed`.

    # Test banks

    Test banks can be used in the staging environment in order to test specific flow during the applicant's financial details aggregation. This can be usefull to simulate a failure or any specific behavior from the third party that provides the financial details aggregation. The impact of using a test bank is described in the following table:

    Test bank |Description
    -----------|-----------
    `alandsbanken`|Simulate a failure from a third party during the financial details aggregation
    _all other banks_|Simulate a successful aggregation of the financial details

    # Callbacks

    Moank can send callbacks to a Partner when an application status is updated. The events that can be reported via callbacks are described in the following table:

    Event |Description
    ------|-----------
    `granted` |Triggered when the customer went through all the checks performed by Moank's underwriters.
    `signed`  |Triggered when the customer has signed his debt notice using BankID.
    `payed-out`|Triggered when Moank has paid out the money to the end customer or the Partner.
    `denied`   |Triggered when Moank denies a customer because of one of the routine checks performed by Moank's underwriters.

    The actual payload and event names sent during the callback can be customised for each partner in order to match their own specifications.

    # Sequence Diagram
    ## Bank Flow
    For an application to reach a 'granted' status, Moank needs to fetch the financial details of the customer. This can be done through this Bank flow. If the application is sent before doing the Bank flow, the application will stay on a 'pending' status until the Partner or Moank's underwriters handles it.

    ## Application Flow
    The application flow allows the partner to create an application in Moank's system and receive our offer based on the customer data. A full decision cannot be made on the application unless the bank flow has been completed.
